This paper provides an anecdotal account of using peer tutors in smaller, underfunded Computer Science programs to provide additional support for introductory courses. The paper reports a great success at the Eastern Mennonite University, reporting higher grades and enthusiasm in the tutored courses, alongside a greater sense of community in the Computer Science major as a whole. Among the great experiences reported by students on feedback forms, it was discovered that peer tutoring is now considered “cool” and that female students appreciated female tutors. Furthermore, the tutors themselves described many benefits in terms of confidence in teaching, the material, and themselves. Interestingly enough, it was suggested that B/C students were extremely valuable tutors because they seemed better able to connect to the difficulties and struggles of the students. The paper also provides a do and don’t list which serve as fairly common sense guidelines as far as teaching goes.
