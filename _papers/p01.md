##### Abstract
* Evidence suggests providing students with hands-on practice is a worthwhile use of class time

##### Introduction
* Computer educators must decide on a particular approach that will be used to teach course material (e.g., lecture, discovery learning)
* Because it has been established that active learning is a valuable classroom approach that can enhance student learning and motivation, one important teaching scenario for computing educators is hands-on practice time provided to students in a classroom setting
    * Evidence suggests that introducing an active component to a computing course may benefit students with regards to engagement and retention
* This paper is about a controlled study in which two different instructional approaches were used on novice computer science students
    * The two instructional approaches differed with respect to the level of control and direction, or initiative, that the tutor exerted during the problem-solving activities 
    * It was found for the two levels of instructor initiative studied here (73% and 55% instructor initiative), there was no significant difference in student learning gains

##### Tutoring Study
* This paper describes an exploratory research study conductedduring a university CS1 course
* In the study, each student workedon a programming exercise while interacting with a dedicatedhuman tutor via remote collaboration software

##### Analysis and Results
* Analysis of the dialogue between the student and tutor they were labeled as student-intitiative mode and tutor initiative mode in which:
    * Student-intiative mode is when the student maintains control and direction over the problem-solving effort
    * Tutor-initiative mode is when the tutor directs the problem solving effort
* One tutor was the proactive tutor which directed the problem solving on average of 73% of the time while the other, referred to as the moderate tutor, took initiative only 55% of the time on average
* Even with the different in initiative between the tutors, there was no statistically significant difference in learning gains

##### Discussion
* There are threats to the validity of this study because different tutors were used
* This experience focused on one-on-one instruction which is unsure to be generalized into a classroom setting

##### Application to CS190J
* Don't overthink when teaching somebody, just take initiative when you think you should and also don't let them "take you hostage"
