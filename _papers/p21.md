Summary:
  Extreme Apprencticeship (XA) is a way of structuring undergraduate mentors such that they serve as an intermediate between TA's and students. Their responsibilities include mentoring students in a 1-1 setting, not in a 1-N setting such as during a TA-led section. Feedback between the mentors and professors was also heavily emphasized. Mentors (called Junior TAs), were asked a free-form questionnaire at the end about their experience. Common themes included mentors expecting learning opportunities, teaching opportunities, and social opportunities. Using a likert scale 1(lowest) - 5(highest), interpersonal skills developed for the Junior TAs were ranked highly (i.e. "I have become more proficient in understanding problems posed by others" had an average rating of 3.72). The program grew from 4 mentors in Fall to 26 the following year. Many students who served as mentors initially also came back to serve again.
